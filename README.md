# ðŸš¦ Bus Driver Reflex Test ðŸšŒ  

**Test your reflexes like a pro bus driver!** 

This interactive game assesses your reaction speed to visual and auditory stimuliâ€”just like on the road. Stay alert, react quickly, and prove you have the skills to handle any situation!  

## ðŸ›  Installation  
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:  
```bash
pip install pygame
pip install pyinstaller
```

## ðŸŽ® How It Works
During the test, you will experience random stimuli:

- ðŸ”´ Red Light â†’ Press with your right hand
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow Light â†’ Stop immediately
- ðŸŸ¢ Green Light â†’ Press with your left foot
- ðŸ“³ Vibration Signal â†’
    - Left hand â†’ Vibration on left hand
    - Right foot â†’ Vibration on right foot

React as quickly as possible! The faster your response, the better your reflexes.

## ðŸ”Š Sound & Visual Feedback
A red, yellow, or green circle will appear on the screen.

A bell or vibration sound will play randomly.

The screen will go black between signals to keep you focused.
